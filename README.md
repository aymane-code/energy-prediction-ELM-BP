This project focuses on predicting the energy produced by wind turbines and solar panels using two machine learning methods: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Backpropagation (BP). It is part of the coursework for the module RNA, Master MLAIM-S2 for the academic year 2023/2024,

The project involves constructing regressors to predict the energy outputs of wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) solar panels based on specific environmental data.
